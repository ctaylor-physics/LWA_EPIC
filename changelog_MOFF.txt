from v1.2 of python-trials:
==========================

In antenna_array.py, 

(*) member function F() replaced with temporal_F() in class
PolInfo does not return any values. Accordingly changed the calls to member
function in __init__(), and update().
(*) Renamed attribute pos in class Antenna, AntennaPair and AntennaArray to
location
(*) Introduced rotation matrix to convert from an individual antenna frame to 
local ENU coordinates in __init__() and update() in Antenna class
(*) Updated the call in Antenna class member function update() to PolInfo member
function update() 
(*) Added attribute 'latitude' to Antenna class
(*) Changed X and Y polarizations to P1 and P2 respectively to avoind confusion 
with x and y spatial coordinates
(*) Changed __init__() in PolInfo to different defaults
(*) Changed __init__() in Antenna to different defaults and added some data 
validation. 
(*) Added save method to class Antenna
(*) Changed gridding weights input type to Antenna class member function update.
(*) renamed spaxis() to spectax() and changed default of shift from True to 
False
(*) Making all time-series FFT shifted to have frequencies in sorted order by
setting shift=True
(*) Antenna class update() member function provides scaling, no scaling or 
explicit options for updating gridding information along frequency channels.
(*) AntennaArray class update() member function can add, remove, or update. The
updates should be provided as a list of dictionaries which will be passed to the
update() member function of individual antenna instances. 
(*) Verbose functionality added to update() member functions in Antenna and 
AntennaArray classes
(*) Added blc and trc attributes to Antenna class for antenna's grid occupation
in __init__() and their estimates in update() member function
(*) Renamed attributes ants_xmin_P1, grid_xmin_P1, etc. in terms of blc and trc
in AntennaArray class
(*) Added grid attributes for both polarizations
(*) Added polarization inputs to gridding methods
(*) Gridding occurs only based on unflagged antennas
(*) Information about individual antenna's influence on grid is stored in the 
form of a dictionary in the antenna's attributes gridinfo_P1 and gridinfo_P2
(*) Incremental gridding features added for addition, removal, and 
modifications of antennas
(*) Renamed function parameter 'spacing' in grid() to 'uvspacing'
(*) Added docstrings for all the functions and class member functions
(*) save() member functions in classes Antenna and AntennaArray need to be 
developed. 

Added a python script MOFF_testing.py for preliminary testing of modules 
developed for MOFF
